# Project Descript
I plan to design a plug-in software for ubc's workday website for personal time management. Since I find that in the workday system, it can only make a timetable that contains all courses in a year, instead of giving separate timetable for each term in a year. Thus, students in the school could use it do a better course management at the start of the semester.

## The main functionality for my software:
- It would support importing pdf timetables downloaded from workday timetable and then separate courses from different terms and then make timetable for each term.
- It will be also avaible for user to type in their courses by inserting information for courses' names, courses' description (*optional, description include location, section type, professor, etc*)
## other extended function:
- Users can also insert their comtemporary planning into daily todo list.
- Users can delete a course section permanently on timetable due to the change of course selection at the start of the term, they can also delet a course section only for one day due the change of course arrangement.
